Practical Python Server Rules
Follow the Discord Community Guidelines and Terms Of Service.
Mods have final say. Feel free to appeal.
No NSFW content is allowed in the server. This is a Python server.
Don't use Racial, Homophobic or Transphobic slurs. Respect all members.
No self-bots. We have enough bots in this server. More just creates spam.
Just ask your question. Dont ask if you can ask your question. 
Keep discussions relevant to channel topics.
Do not DM members without getting their permission first. If you want coding help, use the help channels.
No unapproved advertising, including requests for paid work or your discord server. You can put your project in #-finished-projects with approval.  
Do not try to mention @everyone, or unnecessarily ping members/roles. You should never ping members who are not present in the current discussion, unless they've previously given you permission.



** Violating these rules can result in a warning or ban, depending on how annoying I find you, or how I feel on that particualr day. **
